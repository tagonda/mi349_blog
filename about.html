            <p>WELCOME TO MY BLOG!</p>

            <p>My name is Tess Gonda. I am a senior at Michigan State University, majoring in Computer Science! I'm 20 years old, and I will be turning 21 on November 7th (wooooo). I like music, video games, art, cats, collecting trinkets, and food (among many other things). To the left of this paragraph, you can see a photo of me wearing a comically large hat, which I received from my brother last year. My dad gave it to him for his birthday, however it wasn't his style so he gave it to me instead. This isn't very important but I think it's kinda funny.</p>
